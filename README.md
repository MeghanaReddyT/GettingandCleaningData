**FILES**
* run_analysis.R - This script prepares the data that needs to be cleaned/tidied and performs the following operations as required by the course assignment :
   + Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   + Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   + Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
   + Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   + From the data set in the above step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
* Codebook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
